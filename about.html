        <h2>Where It Started</h2>
        <p>Village Residential was founded in 2023 by Megan Marten — but the work started long before that. With over a decade in the construction industry since 2013, Megan has seen what it takes to transform a home: the planning, the trades, the problem-solving, and the people.</p>
        <p>After years working in the industry, she founded Village Residential to build something of her own — a company with the values, standards, and mission she believed in. A company that treats every project as if it were her own home.</p>

        <h2>The Name</h2>
        <p>The name "Village" is intentional. A home is more than four walls — it's where a family's village begins. It's where kids grow up, where neighbors become friends, where lives are built. We take that seriously.</p>
        <p>We also believe in the village of a neighborhood. When a home is transformed into something beautiful and safe, the whole street benefits. That ripple effect is what drives us.</p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>Village Residential specializes in heavy, full remodels of older homes — the kind of projects that require real expertise, not a coat of paint. We also take on residential flips and new construction, with a focus on the fast-growing Raleigh, NC metro area.</p>
        <p>We hold a North Carolina General Contractor's license and carry full insurance. Every project is done to code, with quality trades and clear communication throughout.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>To give families homes they are proud of — safe, comfortable, modern, and beautiful. Village Residential is a founder-funded, woman-owned company built on personal investment and a deep belief that quality construction makes communities better.</p>
        <p>We're growing — and that same drive and accountability shows up in every project we take on.</p>
